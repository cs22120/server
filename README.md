server
======

This repository holds the code (*et cetera*) to do with the server application.

We are using Mediawiki's [coding
conventions](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/PHP).

## Requirements
We are using the usual LAMP stack, developing for:
* Apache/2.4.6
* PHP 5.5.3
* MySQL 5.5.34

* The `assets` directory must be readable by the web server.
* The `uploads` directory must be writable by the web server.

A rudimentary install wizard is provided at `install.php`.
